**1\. Problem Statement:**

In the current customer support process, ticket assignment is often done manually, leading to delays, confusion, and uneven workload among support agents. This affects both team performance and customer satisfaction.  
The project aims to develop an automated ticket assignment system that distributes tasks based on ticket category, priority, and agent availability to improve efficiency and response time.

**2\. Empathy Map Canvas:**

The Empathy Map Canvas helps the team understand what the users — Admin, Team Manager, and Customer — see, think, feel, and experience during the ticket-handling process.  
It reveals that admins feel overworked, managers feel disappointed with uneven workloads, and customers feel frustrated by delayed responses. These insights guided the team to design a more user-friendly and automated support system.

After grouping and prioritizing ideas, the most effective solutions were selected for implementation, forming the foundation for an efficient and intelligent ticket assignment system.
